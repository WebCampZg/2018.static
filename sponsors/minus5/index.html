        <p>The cozy team you'll be leading displays a huge quantity of real-time sports data on desktop and mobile web by working closely with the backend, managemnet and design team. Because the quality of the products and services we develop is our major concern, we implemented continuous delivery business practice and we deploy our code into production personally. To maintain performance and reliability at high standards, we continuously monitor and upgrade the apps we work on. In order to do that, besides using the newest open source solutions, we develop internal tools as well.</p>

<p>We're constantly experimenting with new trends and technologies, so we were early adopters of the React framework. JavaScript and Node are our daily occurrences, as is SaaS, and we're no strangers to the Go programming language and non-relational databases (MongoDB, Redis).</p>

<p>You're gonna be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizing, mentoring and supporting the frontend team</li>
<li>Understanding the problem and designing the solution</li>
<li>Responsible for the team to deliver what was designed and ensuring each project improves overall code quality</li>
<li>Working closely with other leaders on strategical product planning and initiating projects that align with companies long term goals</li>
</ul>

<p>You've gotta bring:</p>

<ul>
<li>A university degree in technical studies</li>
<li>4+ years of work experience</li>
<li>Prior experience in web application development </li>
<li>Leadership qualities </li>
<li>Understanding of relational databases (SQL Server is an advantage)</li>
<li>Comprehension of UNIX/Linux environment</li>
</ul>

<p>You're gonna get:</p>

<p>Apart from inviting financial compensation, we offer employees flexible working hours and provide top-notch equipment, comfortable & modern working area and a constantly updated common library. We're proud of being a family friendly company, showing understanding for the challenges working parents face today. And because we know great ideas don't emerge on an empty stomach, we currently provide a cooked meal a day (there's even a vege menu!) and we got you covered with paid additional health insurance plan.</p>

<p>Our perfect fit is a person who is keen to know how things work, eager to grow and prefers focusing on one product to working on customer projects. Because our area of expertise is sports and sports betting, we are looking for someone equally enthusiastic about sports as we are! If that's you, apply for this position at careers@minus5.hr in the written form of your choice (CV, LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow).</p>
